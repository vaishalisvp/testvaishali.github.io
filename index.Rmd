Hi, I'm Vaishali! I'm a data scientist currently working at ESMT Berlin. I work on exciting projects in the field of [crowd-sourced social psychology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103115300019), where I examine questions such as how to make psychological research [more reliable](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/03/save-psychology-by-replicating-studies-before-theyre-published/475983/?utm_source=SFTwitter), and how [varying analytic choices affect research outcomes](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245917747646).  

I graduated from the [Hertie School of Governance](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/who-we-are/profile/person/venkatesh-prasad/) with a Masters in Public Policy in the year 2018. I was a [DAAD Helmut Schmidt scholar](https://www.daad.de/der-daad/unsere-aufgaben/entwicklungszusammenarbeit/foerderprogramme/hochschulen/infos/en/43837-helmut-schmidt-programme-public-policy-and-good-governance-ppgg/) during this period, and my masters thesis examined the impact of parental separation on adolescent wellbeing in Germany. I also have a Masters in Economics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.  

I work extensively with R, Python and SQL, and some of the projects I have worked on can be found [here](./posts.html).   

Beyond work, I enjoy playing scrabble and trying different types of coffee (current favourite: Nachammai Estate - medium roast). I'm also passionate about functional fitness - anything from strength training, to hiking or kayaking when the weather's good.
